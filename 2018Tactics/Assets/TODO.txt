Battle UI- Prep for abilities
Cell prefab - add quad to show pathfinding. Add terrain types scriptable object and show terrain types
Camera: Make a start. Rotate by increments of 90. Pan with arrows? Zoom in/out? Perhaps parent camera to empty, rotate empty
Pretty up Overworld.
Map Editor

Idea: Team, shop, and missions can be points on a map. Windows for team, shop, and mission. Drag windows. Need: Icons; home, shop, mission. Maybe have arena instead of missions? Maybe missions too?
Idea2: Path. Some nodes on path has a shop, others have missions

Idea: For map editor. Each enemy spawn position will also have a slot to attach a unit

Idea: Cache cells messed with. Hashset maybe. ClearCellCache, AddCellToCache. Constructors for single, lists, hashsets, and arrays?
Can then reset their colour etc without going through entire grid

Idea: Cell prefab has cellscript. Dictionary of each cellscript. CellClass has hashkey to cellscript. Cellscript contains reference to game object and path mesh child

Idea: Event Manager. Because come on, it would help out by a metric fuck tonne
